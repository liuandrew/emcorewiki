Welcome to The Emcore Documentation Wiki

# Thoughts
This wiki is very much just a plain and simple markdown editor and navigator. All the files are hosted on a [Github repository](https://github.com/liuandrew/emcorewiki), so file management, revision history and such are there. 

In fact, this allows us to use branches and version control through Git. We never have to use the wiki as an editor if we don't want to - we can do it straight through a Git GUI. We could do things like accept changes via pull requests, or anything that you would expect Git to be able to handle.

We have authentication features and User access rights (can limit users to read or read/write privilege for specific pages), though these permissions are not tied to the page, but to the user. Users are handled via MongoDB server rather than Git, so I imagine we can write scripts to handle assigning permissions if we have widespread restrictions or defaults needed.

Overall, this wiki has essentially NO bells and whistles. It is a very minimal program made primarily for viewing, with collaborative editing handled via Git. It is good if we want to keep the documentation system clean and simple (and if we find the Git features like pull requests, branching, git issues, etc., helpful), but beyond that we will not have some additional features common to other wikis like commenting, forums, etc.
